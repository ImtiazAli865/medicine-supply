# Specification Quality Checklist: Foundation — Login, Products, and Stores

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-11-05
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validated in one pass; no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed. Defaults chosen and recorded under Assumptions: account provisioned by the owner (no self-registration or in-app password reset), PKR with two decimals, 200/1,000 character limits, and the duplicate-product rule (exact match blocked, similar match needs confirmation).
- The technology choices (Supabase, Next.js, RLS) live in the constitution and will appear in `/sp.plan`, not here.
